Hunspell-iOS
============

A simple iOS wrapper for the popular Hunspell spell checker. 

It's reasonably quick on the handset. Words can be validated as spelt correct or incorrect in tens of milliseconds. Generating suggestions however can take a little longer depending on the dictionary used but it usually takes < 1 second. 

An example app is included.

The initial wrapper code was influenced by OpenXSpell (http://sourceforge.net/projects/openxspell/).
